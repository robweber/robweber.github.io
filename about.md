I'm Rob, and sometimes I publish code to [GitHub](github-url).

I hope to use this space to provide updates on software repositories I work on and elaborate on thought processes, code examples, and discussions. If nothing else this should help me organize my own thoughts and be able to find information again when I need it.

Many of the project references you'll find here have to do with systems automation, smart home projects, and Kodi media center addons. These projects span the gamut from simple web services, plugins, scripts, or full blown frameworks. Primarily I tend to use Java, Python, and PHP although you're likely to find a bit of everything looking through my repository history.

Here are some links to a few projects I either contribute to, or use, that I find interesting:

* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
* [Kodi Media Center](https://kodi.tv/)
* [SlowMovie](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie)
* [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/)
